in CSS to apply certain style to HTML tag you should write tag that you want to style next then open brackets and write inside that brackets styles that you want to apply.

Example:

body {
background-color: indigo;
}

`body - selector`

`{} - declaration`

`background-color - property`

`: indigo: - value`

To apply styles to specific class you need add dot before the selector.

Example:

.box-1 {
background-color: indigo;
}

Same as for HTML tag but before selector you need add dot.

To use styles on specific HTML tag inside of the specific div class you need write class then the HTML tag that you wanna to style.

Example:

.box-1 h1{
color: black;
}

Also we can specify which class with only some attributes would be affected by adding square brackets.

Example:

.box-1 input[type="submit"]{
color: black;
}

If you want apply style to id you should declare it with hashtag symbol.

Example:

#main-nav-bar{
width: 100%;
}
