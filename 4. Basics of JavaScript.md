There are 3 ways to declare a variable

1. `var` - mostly did not used anymore, global scoped

2. `let` - variable that can be changed later, value can be assigned later

3. `const` - immutable variable, the value must be assigned

In JavaScript there are few datatypes:

1. `string` - regular string

2. `number` - aka integer

3. `boolean` - true OR false

4. `null` - Null type

5. `undefined` - type is undefined

Declaration and Assignment is not the same thing!

You can't assign value to variable without declaring it first.
