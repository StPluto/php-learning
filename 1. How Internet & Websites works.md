## 1. [How does the INTERNET work? | ICT #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg). Video summary:
   
**Internet** is the global network that are connecting clients and servers via cables, routers, and electromagnetic waves.

Each "cog" in this giant machine called internet have unique assigned address named "IP-Address".

**IP-Address** is sequence of numbers. Amount of numbers or parts of numbers differs depending on version of [IP protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol).

This ip-addresses is assisgning by your local ISP.

But it's very hard to remember all these IP addresses that belong to your favorite websites.

This problem led to introducing of DNS-server.

**DNS** is an abbreviation for "Domain Name System".

It's a program to name never ending and everyday changing ip-addresses to human readable "Domains", short elegant website names.

The communication happening between **client** and the **server**.

**Client** - is a typical user who wants to access a resource or site via PC, smartphone, or other devices with an internet connection.

**Server** - is resource handler that accepts requests from client or other servers to provide files or data.

The final diagram of the whole request-response cycle looks like this:

## 2. [How The Web Works - The Big Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug). Video summary:

IP address is divided into two versions: **IPv4** and **IPv6**.

**IPv4** consists of 4 octets of bits, leaving us with a 32-bit address.

**IPv6** is a 128-bit address.

DNS-server: it's basically a large dictionary of pairs "Domain Name":"IP-Address".

Browser is interpreter for source code of server response. It can be HTML, JavaScript, or CSS code.

### What is the switch and why do we need it?

**LAN** (Local Area Network) - is a group of devices that connected into one network.

To form a LAN, we need to connect "End Users" to one or many middleware devices, such as **Switch** or **Acess point**.

**Switch** is a device that can group many end users to one network via cables (optics, copper).

**Access point** is a device that connects end users into one network through a wireless connection (electromagnetic waves).

**Packet** is a basic unit used in communication in the digital network. The insides of a packet can differ depending on the protocol that is currently used.

### What is the router?

**Router** is a device that connects LAN's to daily used Internet. Router receives a packet, looks into it, and sends it in towards the destination point.

We can't make LAN using only routers.

### What does the internet represent?

Internet is just a big network of a routers that connects LANs across the world.

It is very difficult to obtain, install, and maintain a switch and router in every household. There, **Home router** steps in.

**Home router** - is a much cheaper and convenient way to connect a small number of PCs and devices to the internet.

**Routing table** - is dictionary of the instructions that routers follow to reach their destination as fast as possible.

**Network Congestion** - is a situation where some routers reach their capacity and other routers decide to choose a different path than the busy router.

### ~~Connecting to the internet from the computer's perspective? ~~

### Wide Area Network (WAN).

**WAN** (Wide Area Network) - is group of LAN's, that can provide communication between them. WAN is providing private corporate communication inside a company between workers and others.

**VPN** (Virtual Private Network) - is a protocol used to secure connection between routers. VPN encrypt and encapsulate any packet that is going through.

### Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**ISP** (Internet Service Provider) - is a company that is in charge of the transmission of packets between countries, cities, and so on. They install and maintain routers on different levels.

ISP's can be categorized into three parts.

**Local ISP**, **Regional ISP**, and **Global ISP**.

**Local ISP** - are primarily used to connect different places in the range of a few hundred meters to a few kilometers. Usually, they connect neighborhoods and small cities.

**Regional ISP** - is a group of tens and hundreds of Local ISP's. They usually set up to communicate between Local ISP's in big cities and even small regions.

**Global ISP** - is a final form of ISP's. They are used to connect countries that are thousands of kilometers apart and allow them to communicate with each other. Global ISP's are consist of Regional ISP's and some exceptional Local ISP's.

ISP's charging a fee to access the internet.
